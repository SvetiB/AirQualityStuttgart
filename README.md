# AirQualityStuttgart

This is a project in the module "Machine Learning" at the Hochschule der Medien Stuttgart in the summer semester 2020.

The project goal is to predict the particulates in the area of Stuttgart based on real weather and traffic data. 

For the predictions we used Keras to build Neural Networks (LSTM) and SciKit-Learn to create a regression model.
